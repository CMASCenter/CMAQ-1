CMAQ FILES
==========

The input files for CMAQv5 consist of a domain definition file for all programs; two sets of file options for both ICON and BCON; two types of input files (WRF/MM5 and terrain) for MCIP; five mandatory and one optional input file for JPROC; and for CCTM, emissions, initial conditions, and boundary conditions files, six files that define the meteorological conditions to be simulated, and a photolysis rates file. For most CCTM input, a separate data set is required for each horizontal domain that is modeled. When CMAQv5 is configured for in-line emissions and deposition, there are additional emissions input files that are required. CMAQ output files include a basic set of files with aerosol and gas-phase species concentrations, wet and dry deposition estimates, and visibility metrics, and an auxiliary set of output files for diagnosing model performance and in-line-calculated emissions.

CMAQ Input Files
----------------

This section describes each of the input files required by the various CMAQ programs. The section begins with a description of the grid definition file, which is used by several CMAQ programs, and then goes through a program-by-program listing of the CMAQ input file requirements. [Table 8‑1](#Table8-1 "wikilink") lists the source, file type, and temporal and spatial dimensions of each CMAQ input file. Sample disk space requirements for a desired input data set can easily be calculated from the information in [Table 8‑1](#Table8-1 "wikilink"); each data record is four bytes. The I/O API file sizes can be calculated using the number of variables in a CMAQ file and the spatial and temporal coverage of the data. The user should consult the CMAQv5 release notes for additional file information.

### GRIDDESC: Horizontal domain definition

Used by: ICON, BCON, CCTM

The CMAQ grid description file (**GRIDDESC**) is used by all programs except JPROC and MCIP to define the horizontal spatial grid of the modeling domain. GRIDDESC implements [I/O API](#Input.2FOutput_Applications_Programming_Interface_.28I.2FO_API.29 "wikilink") grid conventions: for more details see the section on [Grids and coordinate systems](#Grids_and_coordinate_systems "wikilink").

A GRIDDESC is an ASCII file that contains two sections: a horizontal coordinate section, and grid description section. GRIDDESC is the logical name for text files that store horizontal coordinate and grid descriptions, and that are read by the DSCGRID() and DSCOORD() utility routines. Each segment has a one-line header (which by convention provides titles for the columns in the data records), a sequence of data records, and a terminal record with name field blank (i.e., ' '). The GRIDDESC file is generated automatically with MCIP; alternatively, GRIDDESC can be created using a text editor.

The horizontal coordinate section ([Table 8-2](#Table8-2 "wikilink")) consists of text records that provide coordinate-system name, the map projection, and descriptive parameters P\_ALP, P\_BET, P\_GAM, XCENT, and YCENT.

The grid description section ([Table 8-3](#Table8-3 "wikilink")) consists of text records that indicate the grid name, related coordinate-system name (i.e., which GRIDDESC horizontal coordinate name that is defined in the previous section that is applied to this grid), and descriptive parameters XORIG, YORIG, XCELL, YCELL, NCOLS, NROWS, and NTHIK. For a typical CMAQ application, both "dot-point" and "cross-point" grids are defined in the GRIDDESC file; these grids are topological duals in the sense that the vertices (corners) of one correspond to the cell-centers of the other.

Each data record in these files consists of two or three list-formatted lines (i.e., items are separated by either blanks or commas). Name fields are quoted strings, and appear on the first of these lines. Numeric fields are given in double precision, and occur on either the second line or the second and third lines (this allows you to organize the text so that it is easily viewed in a text editor without running off-screen). The records have the following organization, depending upon whether they are in the first or second segment of GRIDDESC:

` COORD-NAME`
` COORDTYPE, P_ALP, P_BET, P_GAM`
` XCENT, YCENT`

or

` COORD-NAME`
` COORDTYPE, P_ALP, P_BET, P_GAM, XCENT, YCENT`

and

` GRID-NAME`
` COORD-NAME, XORIG, YORIG, XCELL, YCELL`
` NCOLS, NROWS, NTHIK`

or

` GRID-NAME`
` COORD-NAME, XORIG, YORIG, XCELL, YCELL, NCOLS, NROWS, NTHIK`

There are at most 32 coordinate systems and 256 grids listed in one of these files. These files are small enough to be archived easily with a study, and have a sufficiently simple format that new ones can easily be constructed "by hand."

An example of a GRIDDESC file is shown below:

` ' '`
` 'LAM_40N100W'`
` 2 30.0 60.0 -100.0 -100.0 40.0`
` ' '`
` 'M_32_99TUT02'`
` 'LAM_40N100W' 544000.0 -992000.0 32000.0 32000.0 38 38 1`
` ' '`

The horizontal coordinate section (first section) in this example GRIDDESC file defines a horizontal coordinate named “LAM\_40N100W”. The coordinate definition is for a Lambert conformal grid, keyed by the first column of the coordinate description line, which corresponds to the numeric code for the various I/O API-supported grid types (2 = Lambert). The next three parameters (P\_ALP, P\_BET, and P\_GAM) have different definitions for different map projections. For Lambert conformal, P\_ALP and P\_BET are the true latitudes of the projection cone (30°N and 60°N in the example), and P\_GAM (100°W in the example) is the central meridian of the projection. The last two parameters, XCENT and YCENT, are the latitude-longitude coordinates of the grid center of the Cartesian coordinate system, which are 100°W and 40°N in the example. If using WRF-ARW as the meteorological model, the user should be aware of differences from this method.

The example grid definition section above describes a grid named “M\_32\_99TUT02”. The definition of the grid begins with a reference to a coordinate name from the coordinate definition section of the file; in this example, the coordinate named “LAM\_40N100W” is referenced in the grid definition. The next two parameters in the grid definition (XORIG and YORIG) are the east-west and north-south offsets from XCENT and YCENT in meters (WRF-ARW usages may differ). The next two parameters (XCELL and YCELL) are the horizontal grid spacing in meters for the X and Y directions (i.e., delta‑x and delta‑y). The next two parameters (NCOLS and NROWS) are the numbers of grid cells in the X and Y directions. The grid definition concludes with the number of boundary cells, NTHIK, which is typically set to 1.

### [gc|ae|nr|tr]\_matrix.nml: Species namelist files

Used by: BCON, CCTM, ICON, JPROC, PROCAN

Namelist look-up tables for different classes of simulated pollutants are used to define the parameters of different model species during the execution of the CMAQ programs. Gas-phase (gc), aerosol (ae), non-reactive (nr), and tracer (tr) species namelist files contain parameters for the model species that are included in these different classifications. The species namelist files are used to control how the different CMAQ programs and processes handle the model species. The namelist files define the following processes for each model species:

-   Emissions – is the pollutant an emitted species
-   Emissions factor – if the pollutant is an emitted species, uniformly apply a scaling factor to the emissions
-   Deposition velocity – does the pollutant have a deposition velocity
-   Deposition velocity factor – if the pollutant does have a deposition velocity, uniformly apply a scaling factor to this velocity
-   Initial/boundary conditions – is the pollutant in the initial and boundary conditions
-   IC/BC Factor – if the pollutant is in the initial/boundary conditions, uniformly apply a scaling factor to the concentrations
-   Scavenging
-   Scavenging factor
-   Gas-to-aerosol conversion – does the pollutant undergo heterogeneous transformation from the gas-phase to the aerosol-phase
-   Gas-to-aqueous conversion – does the pollutant undergo heterogeneous transformation from the gas-phase to the liquid phase
-   Aerosol-to-aqueous conversion – does the pollutant undergo heterogeneous transformation from the aerosol-phase to the liquid phase
-   Transport – is the pollutant transported by advection and diffustion in the model
-   Dry deposition – Write the pollutant to the dry deposition output file
-   Wet deposition – Write the pollutant to the wet deposition output file
-   Concentration – Write the pollutant to the instantaneous concentration output file

The namelist files contain header information that describe which class of species are contained in the file, the number of parameters contained in the file, headers describing the parameter fields, and then a series of rows with configuration parameters for every model species. Table 8-4 contains the namelist file format for the gas-phase (GC) species namelist file. The namelist files for the other species classifications (AE, NR, TR) are similar to the format shown in Table 8-4.

The namelist files for the other pollutant classes have similar configurations as the gas-phase species configuration shown in [Table 8-4](#Table8-4 "wikilink"). See existing namelist files in the CMAQv5 distribution for examples.

### IC\_PROFILE: Initial conditions vertical profiles

Used by: ICON

ICON can generate initial conditions from two different input file types. The first file type is an ASCII vertical profile file that lists species concentrations at various model layers that are fixed in space and time. To configure ICON to generate initial conditions from ASCII vertical profiles, the “prof” input module is chosen when compiling the program (see Section 5.5 on ICON). These ASCII-formatted vertical profile files are IC\_PROFILE files, and are described in this section. IC\_PROFILE files must be developed by the user and can be generated from climatologically averaged observational data or as an a priori estimate from previous modeling studies of the region being modeled. The second file type that ICON can use to generate initial conditions is a concentration file from a previous CMAQ run. These are CTM\_CONC\_1 files, and are described later in Section 6.1.5.

IC\_PROFILE begins with a header that contains a comment section that describes the data, and a file description section that defines the number of vertical levels in the file, the number of pollutants in the file, and the distribution of the vertical levels. The next entries in IC\_PROFILE are the Julian start date and the start time of the data; they are not used by ICON.

Each line in IC\_PROFILE corresponds to a different pollutant and begins with the name of the pollutant. The subsequent columns on each line list the chemical concentration at each layer contained in the file. Gas-phase species are in ppmV, and aerosol species are in μg m<sup>‑3</sup>. The layer structure of the IC\_PROFILE vertical profiles does not need to correspond exactly to the layer structure that will be modeled; the ICON program will interpolate the data to the correct vertical format for the simulation.

Initial conditions are provided for only the first hour of a model simulation. The initial conditions that are based on an ASCII vertical profile include a gridded file for input to CCTM that has horizontally uniform species concentrations at each model layer. For spatially resolved initial conditions in the horizontal direction, it is necessary to use the other input file type to ICON, an existing CCTM concentration file (CTM\_CONC\_1).

A detailed description of the vertical profile file format for initial conditions is provided in [Table 8-5](#Table8-5 "wikilink"). The header of the profiles file is list-formatted, while the data section of the file is fixed format.

### BC\_PROFILE: Boundary conditions vertical profiles

Used by: BCON

As with the ICON program, BCON can generate boundary conditions from two different input file types. The first file type is an ASCII vertical profile file that list species concentrations at various model layers that are fixed in space in time. To configure BCON to generate boundary conditions from ASCII vertical profiles, the “prof” input module is chosen when compiling the program (see Section 5.2 on BCON). These ASCII-formatted vertical profile files are BC\_PROFILE files, and are described in this section. BC\_PROFILE files must be developed by the user and can be generated from climatologically averaged observational data or as an a priori estimate from previous modeling studies of the region being modeled. The second file type that BCON can use to generate initial conditions is a concentration file from a previous CMAQ run. These are CTM\_CONC\_1 files, and are described later in Section 6.1.5.

BC\_PROFILE begins with a header that contains a comment section that describes the data, and a file description section that defines the number of vertical levels in the file, the number of pollutants in the file, and the distribution of the vertical levels. The next entries in BC\_PROFILE are the Julian start date and the start time of the data; they are not used by BCON. The BCON input consists of four data sections that correspond to the lateral boundaries (i.e., north, south, east, and west) of the model grid. The BCON input profiles contain a field that precedes each data section to indicate which horizontal boundary the data section describes.

The format of the data sections in BC\_PROFILE files is the same as in IC\_PROFILE files. Each line corresponds to a different pollutant and begins with the name of the pollutant. The subsequent columns on each line list the chemical concentration at each layer contained in the file. Gas-phase species are in ppmV, and aerosol species are in g m<sup>‑3</sup>. The layer structure of the BC\_PROFILE vertical profiles does not need to correspond exactly to the layer structure that will be modeled; the BCON program will interpolate the data to the correct vertical format for the simulation.

Boundary conditions can either be time-independent (static) or time-dependent (dynamic). Boundary conditions generated with BC\_PROFILE’s ASCII vertical profiles are both static and spatially uniform along each of the four horizontal boundaries at each model layer. For spatially resolved (in the horizontal direction) and temporally resolved boundary conditions, it is necessary to use the other input file type to BCON, an existing CCTM concentration file (CTM\_CONC\_1).

A detailed description of the vertical profile file format for boundary conditions is provided in Table 8-6. The header of the profiles file is list-formatted, while the data section of the file is fixed format.

### CTM\_CONC\_1: CCTM concentration files

Used by: ICON, BCON

An I/O API GRDDED3-formatted CCTM output concentration file, CTM\_CONC\_1, can be used to create spatially and temporally varying initial and boundary conditions. To configure ICON and BCON to generate initial and boundary conditions from a CCTM concentration file, the “m3conc” input module is chosen when compiling the programs (see Section 5.5 on ICON and Section 5.2 on BCON). The input concentration file must cover a temporal and spatial extent that is consistent with the time period and domain that are being modeled, respectively. Both ICON and BCON require a Julian start date to be specified at execution that identifies the first time step to extract from the input concentration file; BCON also requires a run-length specification to indicate the number of time steps of boundary conditions to extract from the input file. For nested runs, the nested domain for which initial and boundary conditions are being extracted must be on the same projection and fall within the domain contained in the input concentration file.

### CSQY: Absorption cross section and quantum yields

Used by: JPROC

CSQY is the logical name for the ASCII data file containing absorption cross section and quantum yield data for unique photolysis reactions. The data in these files are listed as a function of wavelength and correspond to the standard photolysis reactions in each of the chemical mechanisms implemented in CMAQ. A flexible format allows users to deviate from these standards and test new data with minimal effort.

The ASCII-formatted CSQY files begin with a header that describes the applicable photolysis reaction. This header includes (1) the reaction name/ID; (2) comment lines describing the reaction, the stoichiometry, and the data source (note that comment lines are preceded with a “!”); (3) the location on the wavelength interval that the data represent (beginning, centered, ending, or point); and (4) a multiplier (FAC) that is applied to the photolysis rate calculation. The data section of the CSQY file lists the wavelength of the incoming solar radiation (nm), the absorption cross section (cm), and the quantum yield as columns, with each row corresponding to a specific wavelength interval. The CSQY file uses a space-delimited, free-form format for the data section of the file. A detailed description of the CSQY file format is provided in Table 8-7.

### ET: Extraterrestrial irradiance

Used by: JPROC

ET is the logical name for the ASCII data file containing extraterrestrial radiation as a function of wavelength. The extraterrestrial irradiance file has a format similar to that of the CSQY file (Section 6.1.6). The file begins with a header section; comment lines are preceded with a “!”. Like the CSQY file, the header contains a field describing the location on the wavelength interval that the data represent, and a multiplier. The data section uses a space-delimited, free-form format and lists the wavelength of the incoming solar radiation (nm) and the irradiance (photons cm<sup>‑2</sup> s<sup>‑1</sup>) at each wavelength, with each row corresponding to a specific wavelength interval. A detailed description of the file format is provided in [Table 8-8](Table8-8 "wikilink").

### PROFILES: Atmospheric vertical profiles

Used by: JPROC

PROFILES is the logical name for the ASCII data file containing seasonal and vertical profiles for ozone, aerosol attenuation, temperature, air pressure, and Dobson values. The ASCII-formatted data provided in the PROFILES file are at 19 latitudes (90°N to 90°S) and 51 altitudes (0 to 50 km) in three distinct data sections. The first data section contains seasonal, latitude-dependent vertical profiles of O<sub>3</sub> concentrations (molecules cm<sup>‑3</sup>), air temperature (K), and air density (molecules cm<sup>‑3</sup>). The second data section contains monthly Dobson values at the 19 latitude bands. The last data section contains vertical profiles from the 1976 U.S. Standard Atmosphere of air temperature (K), air density (molecules cm<sup>‑3</sup>), ozone concentrations (molecules cm<sup>‑3</sup>), and aerosol attenuation coefficients (km<sup>‑1</sup>).

The first data section of the PROFILES file is divided into 228 (1934) data blocks, with each block representing one of the three variables (O<sub>3</sub>, air temperature, and air density) at one of the 19 latitude bands, for each of the 4 seasons of the year. The individual data blocks contain 51 values per variable, representing standard conditions at altitudes ranging from 0 to 50 km. The data are ordered, from general to specific, by season (spring, summer, autumn, winter), variable (O<sub>3</sub>, air temperature, air density), latitude, and altitude. For example, the first block in the PROFILES file contains spring O<sub>3</sub> concentration profiles at the latitude band ranging from 90°N to 80°N from 0 to 50 km above sea level; the first value in the block is at 0 km and the last value is at 50 km. The next data block is again spring O<sub>3</sub> concentration profiles but at the latitude band ranging from 80°N to 70°N. The next 17 data blocks complete the spring O<sub>3</sub> concentration profiles by continuing through the rest of the 19 latitude bands, with the last block representing the 80°S to 90°S latitude band. The 20<sup>th</sup> data block begins the spring air temperature profiles at the latitude band ranging from 90°N to 80°N and is followed by 18 more data blocks of spring air temperature profiles. The following 19 data blocks follow an identical format for air density and round out the spring profiles. The 193 data blocks are then repeated for summer profiles, autumn profiles, and finally winter profiles.

The second data section in the PROFILES file contains monthly average Dobson values. The data are organized in 12 rows (January through December) and 19 columns (90°N to 80°N through 80°S to 90°S).

The last data section in the PROFILES file contains vertical profiles from the 1976 U.S. Standard Atmosphere of temperature, air density, ozone concentrations, and aerosol attenuation coefficients. The data are organized in 51 rows, corresponding to altitude (0 to 50 km), with four columns per row for each of the four variables. A detailed description of the file format is provided in Table 8-9.

### BNDY\_CONC\_1: Boundary conditions

Used by: CCTM

CMAQ boundary condition data are of the BNDARY3 file type. Produced by the boundary condition processor, BCON, CCTM reads these data and correlates them with the interior data by the use of a pointer system. This pointer system designates the beginning location of the data in memory that start a new side of the domain (i.e., south, east, north, or west). [Figure 6‑1](#Figure6-1) illustrates this input data structure and the relationship of the boundary data to the interior (“main grid”) data within CMAQ modules.

Each species being modeled should be in the BNDY\_CONC\_1 file. If some modeled species are not contained in this file, the boundary condition for these species will default to the value 1 × 10<sup>‑30</sup>. The perimeter of the CMAQ domain is 1 cell wide, where the number of boundary cells = (2\*NROW)+(2\*NCOL)+4. [Figure 6-2](#Figure6-2 "wikilink") is a graphical example of the CMAQ boundary conditions file; the west and north boundaries have ozone values of 0.035 ppmV, while the east and south boundaries have values of 0.030 ppmV.

### INIT\_CONC\_1: Initial conditions

Used by: CCTM

The initial concentrations of each species being modeled must be input to CMAQ. The initial conditions input file type is GRDDED3 and does not vary with time. The file data are looped in this manner: by column, by row, by layer, by variable. Initial conditions files have the same structure as concentration files, so the predicted concentrations from the last hour of day 1 can be used to initialize the following day’s simulation. This gives CMAQ users the flexibility to segment simulations in any way they choose. [Figure 6-3](#Figure6-3 "wikilink") is a graphical example of the CMAQ initial conditions file. The file shows spatially varying data that can be used to initialize a following run beginning at the time shown (i.e., June 25, 1996 0:00:00).

### JTABLE: Photolysis rates look-up table

Used by: CCTM

Each of the gas-phase mechanisms in CMAQ contains photolysis reactions that require clear-sky reaction rates precomputed from kinetics data at various altitudes and latitude bands. The CMAQ program JPROC (Section 2.2.3) generates photolysis rate look-up tables for input to CMAQ. The photolysis files, called JTABLE, contain a header section that describes the contents of the file, and a data section with clear-sky photolysis rates at different times of the day.

The first line of the header contains the Julian date of the data in the file. This date corresponds to the start date for the simulation that uses the JTABLE data. This is followed by four pairs of data that describe the altitude (m), latitude (degrees), hour angle (from noon), and photolytic reaction name for the data contained in the file. Each data pair begins with a line describing the number of values for each variable and the variable name, followed by the values for each variable. The altitude (variable = LEVELS), latitude (variable = LATITUDES), and hour angle (variable = HOUR ANGLES) variables have fixed values that are hard-coded in the program JPROC (routine jproc.F). The reaction names (variable = PHOTOLYTIC REACTIONS) are mechanism-dependent and vary with the choice of gas-phase mechanism.

The data section of the file contains data blocks that are mapped to the header using a three-digit code. Each block corresponds to an altitude, latitude, and photolysis reaction and contains nine values of clear-sky photolysis rates for the nine hour angles listed in the header. The three-digit code maps the altitude/latitude/reaction number to the data block. For example, the data block that uses the code “3 1 2” corresponds to altitude 3, latitude 1, and reaction 2 as listed in the file header. A detailed description of the JTABLE file format is provided in [Table 8-11](Table8-11 "wikilink"). The files are list-formatted.

### EMIS\_1: Emissions

Used by: CCTM

CMAQ can accept emissions inputs from a variety of emissions models and preprocessors. The most commonly used option is the Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE) modeling system, which is a collection of programs that separately process and merge emissions data for each emissions sector for input to air quality models.

The emissions file sorts the emitted gas-phase and aerosol species by grid cell and time. The file type is GRDDED3, and the units are in moles per second (moles s<sup>‑1</sup>) for gas-phase species and grams per second (g s<sup>‑1</sup>) for aerosol species. The file data are looped as follows: by column, by row, by layer, by variable, and by input time step. CMAQ does not artificially distinguish between surface and elevated emissions sources; elevated sources are provided to CMAQ as vertically resolved emissions. For CCTM configurations that do not use in-line emissions calculations, all emissions estimates are contained within a single input emission file for each day. In v4.7, CMAQ now has the capability to process point-source, sea salt, and biogenic emissions in-line. The supplemental input files to use for calculating the in-line emissions are described i in the CMAQv4.7 release notes.

### OCEAN\_1: Sea salt mask

Used by: CCTM

The CMAQ aerosol model AERO5 can compute sea salt emissions from both open ocean grid cells and surf zone grid cells. The addition of the surf zone option simulates the elevated emissions rates of sea salt in coastal regions where wave action occurs. The OCEAN\_1 file contains data on the fraction of each grid cell that is either open ocean (OPEN) or in the surf zone (SURF). When CCTM is compiled with AERO5, it will expect the OCEAN\_1 file as input.

### GSPRO: Speciation profiles

Used by: CCTM – inline emissions version only

The speciation profile file, GSPRO, contains the factors that are used to separate aggregated inventory pollutant emissions totals into emissions of model species in the form required by CMAQ. If only biogenic emissions are being calculated in-line in CMAQ, the GSPRO file used by CCTM needs to contain split factors only for the biogenic VOC emissions that are input in the B3GRD file. If other emissions sources are being calculated by CCTM, VOC split factors for these other sources must be included in the GSPRO file. The GSPRO file format is listed in the SMOKE user’s manual ([<http://www.smoke-model.org/version2.5/html/ch08s05s02.html>](http://www.smoke-model.org/version2.5/html/ch08s05s02.html)).

The B3GRD file contains normalized emissions calculated with both summer and winter emissions factors. The B3GRD file is generated with the SMOKE program NORMBEIS3 using gridded land use data. For additional information about creating the B3GRD file, see the NORMBEIS3 documentation in the SMOKE users’ manual ([<http://www.smoke-model.org/version2.5/html/ch06s11.html>](http://www.smoke-model.org/version2.5/html/ch06s11.html)).

### BIOSEASON: Freeze dates

Used by: CCTM – inline-emissions version only

The BIOSEASON switch file is an I/O API GRDDED3 file used to indicate which biogenic emissions factor to use on each day in a given year for every grid cell in the modeling domain. This file can be created using the Metscan utility program that is distributed with SMOKE. The BIOSEASON file is time-dependent and usually contains data for an entire year (365 or 366 days). It uses one variable, SEASON, which is either 0 (grid cell should use winter factors for current day) or 1 (grid cell should use summer factors for current day). For additional information about creating the BIOSEASON file, see the Metscan documentation in the SMOKE user’s manual ([<http://www.smoke-model.org/version2.5/html/ch05s11.html>](http://www.smoke-model.org/version2.5/html/ch05s11.html)).

### STK\_GRPS\_\#\#: Stack groups

For additional information about creating the stack groups file, see the ELEVPOINT documentation in the SMOKE user’s manual ([<http://www.smoke-model.org/version2.5/html/ch06s03.html>](http://www.smoke-model.org/version2.5/html/ch06s03.html)).

### STK\_EMIS\_\#\#: Point source emissions

Used by: CCTM – inline emissions version only

The \#\# mark is unique and represents the sector identification.

The elevated-point-source emissions file is an I/O API GRDDED3 file with emissions for point sources to be treated as elevated sources by CCTM. The emissions in this file are distributed through the vertical model layers using a plume-rise algorithm contained in CCTM. The elevated-point-source emissions file can be creating using SMOKE. For additional information about preparing point-source emissions for using the CMAQ in-line plume rise calculation, see the ELEVPOINT documentation in the SMOKE user’s manual ([<http://www.smoke-model.org/version2.5/html/ch06s03.html>](http://www.smoke-model.org/version2.5/html/ch06s03.html)).

Basic CCTM Output Files
-----------------------

The previous section described the output files from JPROC, ICON, BCON, and MCIP that are input to CCTM. In this section, details on the CCTM output files are provided. Except for JPROC (which creates ASCII files), all CMAQ programs produce output files that adhere to the I/O API netCDF format (Chapter 4). The I/O API-formatted CMAQ output files are three-dimensional, gridded, time-stepped binary files that contain headers with metadata describing the file contents. These machine-independent and network transparent binary files are transferable between different computer architectures. In addition to model data output, CMAQ can optionally produce log files that contain the standard output from the various CMAQ processors. If the log file option is not selected by the user, CMAQ will write all of the log information to the screen along with the standard error, which can be captured to a text file using basic UNIXsyntax.

### CMAQ output log

All of the CMAQ processors generate standard output and standard error during execution. For all of the processors other than CCTM, this diagnostic output information can be captured to a log file at execution using a UNIX redirect command. For example, to capture the standard output and error of a BCON simulation, use the following command:

run.bcon \>& bcon\_e1a.log

For CCTM, the LOGFILE environment variable allows users to specify the name of a log file for capturing the standard output from the program. If this variable is not set, the standard output is written to the terminal and can be captured using the UNIXredirect command (“\>”), as shown in the example above.

### CONC: CCTM hourly instantaneous concentration file

The 3-D CCTM hourly concentration file (CONC) is the most commonly referenced CCTM output file. Containing gas-phase species mixing ratios (ppmV) and aerosol species concentra­tions (µg m<sup>‑3</sup>), CONC files include instantaneous model species concentrations at the end of each model hour. The number and types of species contained in the CONC files depend on the chemical mechanism and aerosol model configurations that are selected when CCTM is compiled. The species concentration INCLUDE files (CONC.EXT) within the mechanism INCLUDE directories list the species that are written to the CONC files for each mechanism configuration. The GC\_CONC.EXT file lists the gas-phase species, the AE\_CONC.EXT file lists the aerosol species, and the NR\_CONC lists the nonreactive (inert) species written to the CONC file. Species can be removed from the CONC.EXT files to reduce the number of species that are written to, and thus the size of, the CONC file.

### CGRID: CCTM restart file

The 3-D CCTM ending concentration file (CGRID) is the CCTM restart file. Containing gas-phase species mixing ratios (ppmV) and aerosol species concentrations (µg m<sup>‑3</sup>), the CGRID file includes model species concentrations at the end of each simulation period. The number and types of species contained in the output CGRID files depend on the chemical mechanism and aerosol model configurations that are selected when CCTM is compiled. This file can be used to initialize CCTM from the simulation period that the model completed. For example, if the CCTM is configure to produce daily output files, a CGRID file will be written out at the end of each simulation day.

### ACONC: CCTM hourly average concentration file

The 3-D CCTM integral average concentration file (ACONC) contains average model species concentrations for each model hour, as opposed to instantaneous concentrations at the end of each output time step. The species written to the ACONC file are set by the user in the CCTM run script using the variable AVG\_CONC\_SPCS. The model layers that are used to calculate the integral average concentration are also set in the CCTM run script using the variable ACONC\_BLEV\_ELEV, where BLEV corresponds to the bottom layer number and ELEV corresponds to the top layer number. An example setting for the ACONC\_BLEV\_ELEV variable is “1 6”, which defines layers 1 through 6 as the vertical extent over which to calculate hourly average concentrations.

### DRYDEP: CCTM hourly cumulative dry deposition file

The 2-D CCTM dry deposition file (DRYDEP) includes cumulative hourly dry deposition fluxes (kg hectare<sup>‑1</sup>) for selected model species. CCTM calculates dry deposition for all of the species listed in the dry deposition INCLUDE'' *files within the mechanism INCLUDE directories. Dry deposition INCLUDE* ''files exist for gas-phase species (GC\_DDEP.EXT), aerosol species (AE\_DDEP.EXT), and inert model species (NR\_DDEP.EXT). Species can be removed from the DDEP.EXT files to adjust the number of species that undergo the dry deposition process and are written to the DRYDEP output file.

### WETDEP: CCTM hourly cumulative wet deposition file

The 2-D CCTM wet deposition file (WETDEP) includes cumulative hourly wet deposition fluxes (kg hectare<sup>‑1</sup>) for selected model species. CCTM calculates wet deposition for all of the species listed in the wet deposition INCLUDE files within the mechanism INCLUDE directories. Wet deposition INCLUDE files exist for gas-phase species (GC\_WDEP.EXT), aerosol species (AE\_WDEP.EXT), and inert model species (NR\_WDEP.EXT). Species can be removed from the WDEP.EXT files to adjust the number of species that undergo the wet deposition process and are written to the WETDEP output file.

### AEROVIS: CCTM hourly instantaneous visibility metrics

The 2-D CCTM visibility file (AEROVIS) contains hourly Mie and reconstructed visual range coefficients (km<sup>‑1</sup>) and normalized extinction coefficients (deciviews).

Diagnostic and Advanced CMAQ Output Files
-----------------------------------------

Along with the basic outputs detailed in the previous section, CMAQ can be configured to output several auxiliary files for diagnosing model performance.

### AERODIAM: Instantaneous hourly aerosol diameter file

This diagnostic file contains information on the geometric mean diameters and geometric standard deviations for the lognormal modes.

### B3GTS\_S: Biogenic emissions diagnostic file

This optional 2-D CCTM hourly output file contains calculated biogenic emissions in mass units. The B3GTS\_S file will be produced only if in-line biogenic emissions are being calculated by CCTM and if the B3GTS\_DIAG variable is turned on.

### DEPV\_DIAG: CCTM inline deposition diagnostics file

Add content

### DUST\_EMIS

Add content

### FLOOR: concentration-reset diagnostics file

FLOOR files are optional output diagnostic files which list specific gridboxes/timesteps in which species with `-ve` concentrations are reset to zero.

### INIT\_MEDC\_1

Add content

### IRR: Process analysis output – integrated reaction rates

The 3-D CCTM integrated reaction rate file (IRR) contains hourly concentrations of selected model output species in terms of the gas-phase chemistry pathways that contributed to the predicted concentration at each hour. For each grid cell in the process analysis domain (which is most likely a subset of the full modeling domain), the IRR file shows the hourly change in species concentration that is due to particular gas-phase chemistry reactions or reaction groups. The process analysis preprocessor, PROCAN (Section 2.2.6), is used to select the process analysis domain, the model species for which to capture process analysis information, and the chemistry reactions or groups of reactions to track during the process analysis.

### LTNGOUT

Add content

### PA: Process analysis output – integrated process rate file

The 3-D CCTM integrated process rate file (PA) contains hourly concentrations of selected model output species in terms of the model process that contributed to the concentration in each grid cell at each hour. For each grid cell in the process analysis domain (which is most likely a subset of the full modeling domain), the PA file shows the hourly change in species concentration that is due to the major model processes, such as horizontal and vertical advection, chemistry, and wet deposition. The process analysis preprocessor, PROCAN (Section 2.2.6), is used to select the process analysis domain, the model species for which to capture process analysis information, and the model processes to track during the process analysis.

### PLAY\_SRCID

Add content

### PT3D\_DIAG

Add content

### RJ: In-line photolysis output – gridded photolysis rates

The photolysis diagnostic output files (RJ) contain the photolysis rates calculated by CCTM when the in-line photolysis option is used.

### SOILOUT

Name and location of hourly soil NO emissions file; output when in-line biogenic emissions processing is activated by setting CTM\_BIOGEMIS to “T” or “Y”.

### SSEMIS: Sea salt emissions diagnostic file

This optional 2-D CCTM hourly output file contains calculated sea salt emissions. The SSEMIS file will be produced by CCTM only if the AERO5 aerosol mechanism is being used and if the CTM\_SSEMDIAG variable is turned on.

### WETDEP2: CCTM cloud diagnostics file

The 2-D CCTM wet deposition file (WETDEP2) includes cumulative hourly wet deposition fluxes (kg hectare<sup>‑1</sup>) for selected model species. CCTM calculates wet deposition for all of the species listed in the wet deposition INCLUDE files within the mechanism INCLUDE directories. Wet deposition INCLUDE files exist for gas-phase species (GC\_WDEP.EXT), aerosol species (AE\_WDEP.EXT), and inert model species (NR\_WDEP.EXT). Species can be removed from the WDEP.EXT files to adjust the number of species that undergo the wet deposition process. These extra species are written to the WETDEP2 output file.

In CMAQ, wet deposition is calculated separately for resolved (grid-scale) clouds and for convective (subgrid) clouds. The WETDEP1 files contain the total wet deposition, i.e., the sum of both resolved-scale and subgrid-scale deposition. The WETDEP2 file contains only subgrid-scale deposition, plus some cloud diagnostic variables.
